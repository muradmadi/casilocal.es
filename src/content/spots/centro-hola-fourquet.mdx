## First Impressions
Hola Fourquet, tucked away in a quiet corner of Centro, is a breath of fresh air compared to the tourist traps near Sol. This petite cafe, with its rustic decor and inviting terraza, feels like a de toda la vida spot, where locals gather for a caña or a café con leche. As you step inside, you're greeted by the aroma of specialty coffee and the soft hum of conversation, a far cry from the chaos of Gran Vía.

## The Setup
The workspace at Hola Fourquet is cozy, with a mix of small tables and comfortable seating areas. While it's not the most spacious spot, the layout is well-thought-out, with plenty of natural light pouring in through the large windows. You'll find a few power outlets scattered throughout the cafe, including a couple near the window seats and one by the bar. The wifi is reliable, making it an excellent spot to get some work done during the post-siesta rush. Just be sure to avoid la hora del vermut, when the cafe can get a bit crowded with locals gathering for a pre-dinner drink.

## The Coffee
The coffee at Hola Fourquet is, without a doubt, the star of the show. Their specialty coffee drinks are expertly crafted, with a focus on unique flavors and high-quality beans. The baristas are knowledgeable and happy to chat about their latest offerings, from single-origin pour-overs to creative signature drinks. If you're feeling adventurous, try their seasonal coffee cocktail, which is sure to please even the most discerning palates. And, of course, no visit to Hola Fourquet would be complete without ordering a traditional Spanish breakfast, complete with a strong café con leche and a side of crispy churros.

## The Verdict
Overall, Hola Fourquet is a hidden gem in the heart of Centro, offering a unique blend of specialty coffee, cozy atmosphere, and local charm. While it may not be the most productive spot for those who require absolute silence or ample power outlets, it's an excellent choice for remote workers who value good coffee, a welcoming vibe, and a taste of authentic Madrid. So, skip the trendy cafes in Malasaña and head to Hola Fourquet instead, where you can experience the real Madrid, una caña at a time.
