## First Impressions
Eatmytrip, tucked away on a side street in Malasaña, is a breath of fresh air compared to the usual hipster nonsense that plagues this barrio. As a local, I've grown tired of the overly-caffeinated, try-hard spots that seem to pop up every other week, but Eatmytrip feels like a genuine find. The exterior is unassuming, with a small terraza that's perfect for sipping a caña on a warm afternoon. Inside, the decor is eclectic and charming, with vintage touches that add to the cafe's de toda la vida vibe.

## The Setup
When it comes to getting work done, Eatmytrip has its pros and cons. The seating area is cozy, with a mix of small tables and larger communal areas that are perfect for meeting with colleagues or collaborating on a project. However, the outlet situation is a bit of a free-for-all, with only a handful of plugs scattered throughout the cafe. Your best bet is to grab a seat at the bar or near the window, where you can usually find a reliable outlet. The wifi is fast and reliable, making it a great spot to get some work done during the 11am café con leche crowd or the post-siesta rush.

## The Coffee
The coffee at Eatmytrip is top-notch, with a variety of specialty drinks that are expertly crafted by the friendly baristas. The cafe con leche is rich and creamy, and the pour-overs are always a hit with the coffee snobs. If you're feeling hungry, the brunch menu is extensive and delicious, with everything from classic tortilla española to more adventurous dishes like shakshuka. Be sure to skip the overly-hyped "signature" drinks and stick with the classics – trust me, you won't be disappointed.

## The Verdict
Overall, Eatmytrip is a great spot for remote workers who are looking for a laid-back, authentic Madrid experience. Unlike the tourist traps near Sol, this cafe feels like a true neighborhood staple, with a loyal following of locals who come for the great coffee and friendly service. Just be sure to avoid la hora del vermut (around 1-3 pm), when the cafe can get a bit crowded and noisy. If you're looking for a reliable spot to get some work done, grab a seat at the bar and order a café con leche – you won't regret it. And if you're feeling adventurous, take a stroll around the neighborhood and explore the charming streets and shops that make Malasaña so special.
