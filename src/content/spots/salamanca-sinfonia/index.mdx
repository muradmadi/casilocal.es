## First Impressions
Sinfonía, tucked away in the Goya area of Salamanca, is a breath of fresh air compared to the overly trendy cafes that have popped up in Malasaña. This barrio is de toda la vida, with its upscale boutiques and refined atmosphere, making Sinfonía a perfect fit. As you step inside, you're greeted by the aroma of specialty coffee and the soft hum of conversation, a far cry from the chaotic streets of Sol. The decor is elegant, with a touch of modern flair, and the staff is friendly, with a few speaking English - a bonus for us digital nomads.

## The Setup
The workspace at Sinfonía is cozy, with a few small tables by the window and a larger table in the back that's perfect for meetings or group work. The seating area is comfortable, with plush chairs and sofas, and the lighting is warm and inviting. As for plugs, you'll find a few outlets scattered around the room, but be prepared to ask the staff to move a chair or two to access them. The wifi is available upon request, and while it's not the fastest, it gets the job done. Be aware that the cafe can get crowded during the post-siesta rush, so it's best to come early or late to avoid the chaos.

## The Coffee
The coffee at Sinfonía is, without a doubt, the main attraction. Their specialty coffees are expertly crafted, and they offer a range of lactose-free milk options - a must for those with dietary restrictions. The cafe con leche is rich and creamy, and the pour-overs are a work of art. If you're feeling peckish, the food menu is varied and delicious, with options ranging from traditional Spanish tapas to more modern creations. Be sure to try the tortilla de patatas, it's a standout. And, of course, no visit to Sinfonía would be complete without a caña of coffee on the terraza, people-watching as the Madrid locals go about their day.

## The Verdict
Sinfonía is a solid choice for remote workers looking for a reliable spot to get some work done. While it's not the most ideal spot for a full-day work session, it's perfect for a few hours of focused work or a casual meeting. The coffee is exceptional, and the atmosphere is welcoming and refined. Just be sure to avoid the 11am café con leche crowd and the pre-vermut hour rush, and you'll be golden. Overall, Sinfonía is a hidden gem in the heart of Salamanca, and it's definitely worth a visit - or two, or three.
