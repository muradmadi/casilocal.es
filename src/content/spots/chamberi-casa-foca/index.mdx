## First Impressions

The suggestion to review **Casa Foca** came directly from our users, and you are quite lucky—we had already started preparing a dossier on this space before the request came in, so we simply pulled it from the draft stack.

Located in Chamberí (Calle de Caracas, 8), Casa Foca does not attempt to be a high-throughput corporate hangar. It avoids the sterilized, "tech-bro" aesthetic common in Madrid’s central hubs. The immediate impression is one of curated intimacy—less "office" and more "wealthy friend’s living room." It is compact, arguably tight. If you are looking for vast, echoing halls to pace around in while on a call, this is not it. It feels dense, intentional, and quiet enough to focus, but lively enough to remind you that you are in a city.

*(Note: The images in this review are currently sourced from their Instagram. We will update these with our own photography upon our next site visit to verify consistency.)*

## The Setup

Let’s be analytical about the ergonomics, as "cozy" often translates to "back pain" in the coworking world.

Casa Foca operates on a hybrid model: it is effectively a specialty coffee shop structured for work. The seating is a mix of cafe-style tables and dedicated work surfaces.

* **The Good:** Power outlets are generally accessible, and the density creates a "library effect"—peer pressure to work rather than socialize.
* **The Bad:** This is not an ergonomic haven. You will not find rows of Herman Miller Aerons here. If your workflow requires dual monitors and lumbar support for an 8-hour sprint, the cafe-style seating may fatigue you by hour four.
* **The Logic:** It prioritizes *flow* over *infrastructure*. It is optimized for the laptop-only creative or the writer, not the day-trader or the full-stack dev needing a command center.

## The Coffee & Sustenance

This is the space's strongest leverage point against traditional coworking spots. Most coworking spaces offer "free coffee" that is arguably industrial runoff. Casa Foca serves **NOMAD Coffee** (a high-grade specialty roaster from Barcelona).

This is a critical distinction. You are not paying for access to a push-button machine; you are paying for barista-grade extraction. They use **Rude Health** for alternative milks (Oat, Coconut, Almond), which suggests they aren't cutting costs on consumables. The food menu leans toward "fuel" rather than "meals"—expect vegan sponge cakes, alfajores, and cinnamon rolls. It is functional indulgence, designed to keep you at the desk, not distract you from it.

## The Verdict

The value proposition here rests entirely on the pricing model, which our users specifically asked us to highlight.

**The Deal:** A **20€ Day Pass** (valid for roughly 8 hours/full day).

* *The nuance:* This is often structured as a minimum consumption model or a pass that includes consumption credits (verify current specifics at the counter, as policies fluctuate). Compared to the standard 25€-30€ day passes in Madrid that offer nothing but an empty desk, getting 20€ worth of NOMAD coffee and food *with* your workspace is mathematically superior.

**Critique:** Casa Foca is an antidote to the WeWork industrial complex, but it carries the risks of a boutique operation. Space is finite. If you arrive late, you may not find a spot. If you need absolute silence for sensitive calls, the ambient cafe noise will be a friction point.

**Go if:** You value caffeine quality over ergonomic perfection and need a focused, aesthetic environment for creative tasks. **Avoid if:** You require a private office, strict silence, or enterprise-grade desk setups.
