## First Impressions
Boconó, tucked away in the heart of Centro, is a breath of fresh air compared to the overcrowded cafes near Puerta del Sol. This charming spot, with its elegant facade and inviting terraza, is a hidden gem that's easy to miss if you're not a local. As someone who's lived in Madrid for years, I can appreciate the understated charm of Boconó, which sets it apart from the trendy cafes in Malasaña. On a typical morning, you'll find the 11am café con leche crowd spilling out onto the sidewalk, enjoying the gentle breeze and lively chatter of the barrio.

## The Setup
Unlike the usual suspects in the area, Boconó has a no-frills approach to seating and workspace. The interior is cozy, with a handful of small tables and a beautiful wooden bar that's perfect for sipping a caña or enjoying a coffee. However, if you're looking to get some work done, you might want to think twice - there are limited outlets, and they're mostly concentrated near the bar. The best time to come is during the post-siesta rush, when the cafe is bustling but not overcrowded. Be sure to grab a seat near the window to take advantage of the natural light and people-watching opportunities.

## The Coffee
Boconó takes its coffee seriously, with a selection of specialty brews and expertly crafted pour-overs. The baristas are knowledgeable and passionate about their craft, happy to guide you through the menu and recommend the perfect cup to suit your taste. If you're feeling peckish, the pastries are delicious, but be sure to skip the overly sweet treats and opt for something more traditional, like a torta de aceite. And don't even get me started on the vermut hour - avoid Boconó during la hora del vermut, unless you want to navigate a crowded room filled with lively locals enjoying their afternoon tipple.

## The Verdict
In conclusion, Boconó is a wonderful spot for a casual meetup or a quick coffee break, but it's not the most practical choice for remote workers. The lack of outlets and limited seating make it challenging to get work done, and the no-laptop policy is strictly enforced. That being said, if you're looking for a charming cafe to relax and enjoy a cup of coffee, Boconó is an excellent choice. Just be sure to come during off-peak hours, and don't forget to appreciate the beautiful architecture and lively atmosphere of the surrounding barrio - it's de toda la vida, after all.
