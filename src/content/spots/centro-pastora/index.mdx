## First Impressions
Pastora, tucked away in a quiet street of Centro, is a breath of fresh air compared to the overcrowded cafes near Puerta del Sol. This charming spot has a distinct de toda la vida vibe, reminiscent of old Madrid, with its rustic decor and lively chatter. As you step in, you're immediately enveloped by the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of conversation, making it an ideal spot to escape the chaos of the city. Unlike the tourist traps near Sol, Pastora is a local favorite, attracting a loyal crowd of Madrileños who appreciate its authenticity.

## The Setup
The workspace at Pastora is cozy, with a handful of small tables and a bar that's perfect for solo workers or those who prefer to sit at a counter. The seating area is limited, but the tables by the window offer a lovely view of the street, making it a great spot to people-watch. In terms of practicalities, there are a few outlets scattered around the room, including one near the window and another by the bar, so you can keep your devices charged. However, be mindful of the post-siesta rush, when the cafe fills up with locals grabbing a quick caña or coffee before heading back to work. If you're looking for a dedicated workspace, it's best to arrive before 11am or after 3pm to avoid the crowds.

## The Coffee
Pastora's coffee is, without a doubt, one of its strongest selling points. Their specialty coffee drinks are expertly crafted, and the baristas are more than happy to guide you through their menu. The cafe con leche is a must-try, made with high-quality beans and a generous dollop of foam. If you're feeling adventurous, try their signature drink, the "Café de la Casa," which is a delicious blend of coffee, chocolate, and spices. Be sure to pair it with one of their delicious pastries or toast, freshly baked in-house.

## The Verdict
While Pastora may not be the most conventional workspace for remote workers, it's an excellent spot for those who value character and a genuine Madrid experience. If you're looking for a no-frills, laid-back atmosphere with exceptional coffee, Pastora is an excellent choice. Just be sure to avoid la hora del vermut, when the cafe fills up with locals enjoying a pre-lunch drink, and opt for a quieter time of day. With its unique charm, delicious coffee, and prime location in the heart of Centro, Pastora is a hidden gem that's sure to become a favorite among digital nomads and locals alike.
