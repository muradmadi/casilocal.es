## First Impressions

Four Specialty Coffee is a clinical, minimalist enclave located near the Royal Palace and the frantic orbit of Puerta del Sol. Unlike the historic, wood-heavy "de toda la vida" spots in the area, Four utilizes a Scandinavian-chic palette—natural light, clean lines, and an airy atmosphere. It functions as a tactical secret for those who find the neighboring "tourist traps" of Gran Vía operationally unusable.

## The Setup

Four is architecturally designed to accommodate the modern professional, but with specific policy constraints. The space features a prominent communal table toward the rear, which serves as the primary hub for solo workers.

While outlets are strategically placed, the venue has recently aligned with a growing trend in Madrid's specialty scene: **laptops are strictly prohibited on weekends**. During the week, working is permitted, but the ergonomics are best suited for the morning window (pre-1:30 PM). After this, the space pivots toward lunch service and social "Natural Wine" hours. The Wi-Fi is a major asset—fast and unlimited—making it a viable location for battery-heavy or data-intensive projects during permitted hours.

## The Coffee

The technical execution at Four is among the most consistent in the city center. They maintain a rotating selection of local roasts (often from the likes of Hola Coffee) and specialty natural wines. The cortado is the benchmark here: precisely balanced and served at a professional temperature.

The food program is not an afterthought. The kitchen specializes in high-concept brunch staples, such as Turkish Eggs and French Toast, which elevate it above the generic pastry-and-coffee model. While the original review suggests grabbing a "cold caña from the fridge" to blend in, the real draw here is the curation of natural wines—a signal of its dual identity as a daytime workspace and an evening social cellar.

## The Verdict

Four Specialty Coffee is a high-performance "half-day" base for remote workers. It offers superior technical infrastructure (power and fiber) compared to the gritty, authentic neighborhood bars, but it demands compliance with its weekday-only laptop policy. It is an ideal spot for focused morning sessions and high-quality caloric intake. If you need a weekend office, you will be disappointed; if you need a Monday-through-Friday sanctuary with elite caffeine, it is a premier choice.

**Security Note:** The minimalist, open-plan layout offers decent sightlines, but the high foot traffic near the Royal Palace means you should never leave devices unattended. Use a VPN on the shared fiber network for all professional traffic.
