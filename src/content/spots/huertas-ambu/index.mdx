## First Impressions
Ambu cafe in Huertas is a breath of fresh air in a neighborhood that's equal parts charming and chaotic. Tucked away on a side street just a stone's throw from the Plaza de Santa Ana, this tiny cafe is a de toda la vida spot that's managed to fly under the radar of most tourists. Unlike the overpriced, soulless coffee shops that line the Calle de la Princesa, Ambu feels like a genuine neighborhood hangout, the kind of place where you can grab a caña or a café con leche and catch up on the latest barrio gossip.

## The Setup
The workspace at Ambu is cozy, to say the least - think small tables, mismatched chairs, and aterraza that's just big enough for a handful of people to squeeze onto. It's not the most ideal setup for remote workers, but if you can snag a spot near one of the few outlets (there's one near the window, and another by the door), you'll be golden. The seating area is cramped, but the comfortable cushions and abundance of natural light make it a pleasant spot to while away an hour or two. Just be aware that the wifi can be a bit spotty, and the post-siesta rush can get pretty loud - not ideal for focused work, but perfect for a casual meeting or coffee break.

## The Coffee
Ambu's coffee is, without a doubt, the main draw. The baristas are knowledgeable and passionate, and the variety of specialty coffee drinks is impressive. From expertly pulled shots of espresso to intricate pour-overs, the coffee at Ambu is always top-notch. The 11am café con leche crowd can get a bit rowdy, but the staff handles it with ease, doling out perfectly balanced cups of coffee with a side of friendly chatter. If you're feeling adventurous, try the seasonal coffee drinks - the summer menu features some truly innovative flavor combinations that are perfect for sipping on the terraza.

## The Verdict
For remote workers, Ambu cafe is a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, the coffee is exceptional, and the atmosphere is welcoming and relaxed. On the other hand, the lack of reliable wifi and limited outlet options make it less than ideal for focused work. That being said, if you're looking for a charming spot to grab a coffee or meet with colleagues, Ambu is hard to beat. Just avoid "la hora del vermut" (you don't want to get caught in the pre-dinner rush), and be prepared for a potentially loud and lively atmosphere. Order the café con leche, skip the pastries (they're not the strongest suit), and enjoy the people-watching on the terraza - you won't be disappointed.
