## First Impressions
Sood, nestled in the charming barrio of Retiro, is a breath of fresh air compared to the tourist traps near Sol. This quaint cafe, with its inviting facade and cozy interior, is a hidden gem that even some locals might not know about. As I stepped inside, I was greeted by the friendly staff and the aroma of specialty coffee, which immediately drew me in. The atmosphere is relaxed, with a hint of elegance, making it an ideal spot to unwind and enjoy a caña or a cup of coffee.

## The Setup
The workspace at Sood is thoughtfully designed, with ample seating and strategically placed power outlets, including a few near the large windows overlooking the street. The terraza, although small, is a lovely spot to people-watch and soak up the sun, especially during the post-siesta rush. However, be aware that the cafe can get quite busy, especially during the 11am café con leche crowd, so it's best to arrive early or later in the afternoon to secure a comfortable spot. The wifi, which I was pleased to find, is reliable and fast, making it an excellent spot for remote workers who need to stay connected.

## The Coffee
The coffee at Sood is, without a doubt, one of the best in the city. Their specialty coffee selection is impressive, with a range of unique blends and expertly crafted pour-overs. I opted for the cortado, which was rich and velvety, with just the right balance of coffee and milk. The food selection, although limited, is de toda la vida, with delicious pastries and sandwiches that pair perfectly with their coffee. Be sure to try their famous churros, which are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, and pair them with a rich, chocolatey dipping sauce.

## The Verdict
Overall, Sood is an excellent choice for remote workers and coffee enthusiasts alike. While it may not be the cheapest option in the city, the quality of the coffee and the welcoming atmosphere make it well worth the extra euros. Just be sure to avoid la hora del vermut, when the cafe can get quite busy, and opt for a quieter time to enjoy your coffee and get some work done. With its unique character, excellent coffee, and comfortable workspace, Sood has earned a spot as one of my favorite cafes in Madrid, and I'm sure it will become a staple for many remote workers and locals alike.
