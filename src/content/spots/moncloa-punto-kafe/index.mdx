## First Impressions
Punto Kafé in Moncloa is a breath of fresh air compared to the generic cafes that line Calle de Princesa. Tucked away on a side street, this cozy spot has a de toda la vida feel that's hard to find in a city that's increasingly catering to tourists. As a local, I appreciate the understated decor and the fact that it's not trying to be a trendy Malasaña cafe. The outdoor seating area, or terraza, is a great spot to people-watch and enjoy a caña on a warm afternoon.

## The Setup
The workspace at Punto Kafé is surprisingly functional, with plenty of outlets located near the large windows and along the bar. The seating area is comfortable, with a mix of small tables and larger ones that can accommodate groups or laptop-wielding remote workers. The best time to come is during the post-siesta rush, around 4-5 pm, when the 11am café con leche crowd has dissipated and the atmosphere is more relaxed. Avoid coming during la hora del vermut, when the cafe can get crowded with locals grabbing a quick drink before dinner.

## The Coffee
The coffee at Punto Kafé is top-notch, with a variety of specialty drinks made with high-quality beans. The baristas are knowledgeable and happy to guide you through the menu, which includes everything from traditional cortados to more unusual pours. The food menu is also impressive, with a range of delicious pastries and light bites that are perfect for a quick snack or lunch. Be sure to try the tortilla de patatas, which is made fresh in-house and is a great accompaniment to your coffee.

## The Verdict
Overall, Punto Kafé is a solid choice for remote workers who need a reliable and comfortable spot to get some work done. With its functional workspace, excellent coffee, and comfortable seating area, it's a great alternative to the noisy cafes in Sol or the hipster spots in Malasaña. While it may not be the cheapest option, the quality of the food and drinks makes it well worth the extra cost. As a local, I'd give Punto Kafé a solid 8 out of 10, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great cafe experience in Moncloa.
