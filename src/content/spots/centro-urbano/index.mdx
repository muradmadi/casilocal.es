## First Impressions
Urbano in Centro is a breath of fresh air, tucked away on a quiet street just a stone's throw from the bustling Plaza Mayor. Unlike the tourist traps near Sol, this charming cafe feels like a de toda la vida spot, where locals come to enjoy a caña or a café con leche without the fuss. The exterior is unassuming, but the interior is warm and inviting, with plenty of natural light pouring in through the large windows. It's the perfect spot to escape the chaos of the city and enjoy a relaxed morning or afternoon.

## The Setup
The workspace at Urbano is cozy, with a few small tables and a comfortable seating area near the window. The plugs are conveniently located, with a few outlets near the tables and a long counter with plenty of space to spread out your laptop and notes. The seating is comfortable, with plush couches and armchairs that are perfect for sinking into with a good book or a laptop. The best time to come is during the post-siesta rush, when the 11am café con leche crowd has dissipated and the cafe is quiet and peaceful. Avoid coming during la hora del vermut, when the cafe can get crowded with locals enjoying a pre-dinner drink.

## The Coffee
The coffee at Urbano is exceptional, with a wide range of specialty drinks and expertly pulled shots. The baristas are knowledgeable and passionate about their craft, and are happy to guide you through the menu and recommend drinks. The cafe con leche is rich and creamy, and the cortado is perfectly balanced. Be sure to try the seasonal specials, which are always creative and delicious. And don't skip the pastries, which are freshly baked and perfect for accompanying your coffee.

## The Verdict
Overall, Urbano is a hidden gem in the heart of Centro. While it may not be the most obvious choice for remote workers, it's a great spot to come and get some work done in a peaceful and comfortable environment. The staff are friendly and accommodating, and the coffee is top-notch. Plus, the location is convenient, with plenty of nearby landmarks like the Plaza Mayor and the Mercado de San Miguel. So if you're looking for a quiet and relaxing spot to work or meet with friends, Urbano is definitely worth a visit. Just be sure to arrive early, before the crowds descend and the cafe gets busy.
