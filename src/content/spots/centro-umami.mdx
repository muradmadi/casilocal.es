## First Impressions
Umami, tucked away in a quiet corner of Centro, is a breath of fresh air compared to the tourist traps near Sol. This unassuming cafe has been gaining a loyal following among locals and remote workers alike, and for good reason. As you step inside, you're greeted by the friendly staff and the aroma of expertly brewed coffee, a welcome respite from the chaos of Calle de la Victoria. The decor is understated yet elegant, with a hint of industrial chic that sets it apart from the more traditional cafes in the area.

## The Setup
The workspace at Umami is thoughtfully designed, with ample seating and strategically placed power outlets - you'll find them near the windows, beneath the sleek wooden tables, and even in the cozy outdoor terraza. The wifi is reliable and fast, making it an ideal spot to get some work done during the post-siesta rush. The 11am café con leche crowd can get a bit lively, but the staff are always happy to accommodate remote workers, and the background noise is more muted than you'd find at some of the trendier spots in Malasaña. Be sure to grab a seat near the window to people-watch and take in the sights of the bustling streets of Centro.

## The Coffee
Umami's specialty coffee is, without a doubt, some of the best in the city. Their expertly crafted pour-overs and cortados are a must-try, and the staff are more than happy to guide you through their rotating selection of single-origin beans. Skip the caña (that's a small beer, for non-locals) and opt for a coffee instead - you won't be disappointed. And if you're feeling peckish, their selection of tostadas and pastries is de toda la vida - classic, uncomplicated, and delicious.

## The Verdict
All in all, Umami is a hidden gem in the heart of Centro. While it may not be the most obvious choice for remote workers, its reliable wifi, ample seating, and exceptional coffee make it an excellent spot to get some work done. Just be sure to avoid la hora del vermut (that's around 1-3 pm, when the locals come out to play) and you'll be golden. With its unique blend of style, substance, and Madrid charm, Umami is a must-visit for anyone looking to experience the real Centro - and get some work done in the process.
