## First Impressions
Misión in Centro is a breath of fresh air amidst the chaos of Calle de la Victoria and the tourist traps near Sol. Tucked away on a side street, this cafe is a de toda la vida spot that's managed to maintain its local charm, even as the neighborhood has gentrified. Unlike the hipster nonsense that's taken over Malasaña, Misión feels like a genuine Madrid institution, with a warm and inviting atmosphere that's perfect for a casual meeting or a quick breakfast.

## The Setup
The workspace at Misión is cozy, with a handful of small tables and a few stools at the bar. While it's not ideal for laptop work, there are a few outlets scattered around the room, including one near the window that's perfect for plugging in and people-watching. The seating area is small, but the terraza out front is a great spot to grab a caña or a coffee and enjoy the street scene. Be warned, though: the 11am café con leche crowd can get a bit rowdy, and the post-siesta rush is not the best time to come if you're looking for a quiet spot to work.

## The Coffee
The coffee at Misión is top-notch, with a expertly pulled café con leche that's strong enough to knock you off your feet. The pastries are also delicious, with a variety of traditional Spanish treats like churros and tortas. The menu is simple, but everything is made with high-quality ingredients and a clear passion for the craft. Skip the touristy breakfast dishes and opt for something simple like a tostada con tomate or a slice of tortilla española.

## The Verdict
Misión is a great spot for remote workers who don't need to spend all day glued to their laptops. It's perfect for a quick breakfast meeting or a mid-morning coffee break, and the atmosphere is always lively and welcoming. While it may not be the best fit for those who need a dedicated workspace, it's a fantastic addition to the Centro neighborhood, and a great alternative to the more crowded and touristy spots in the area. Just be sure to avoid la hora del vermut, when the cafe can get a bit crowded with locals enjoying a pre-lunch drink. Overall, Misión is a must-visit for anyone looking for a authentic Madrid cafe experience.
