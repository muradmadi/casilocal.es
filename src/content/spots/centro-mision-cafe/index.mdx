## First Impressions

Misión Café, located on the quieter Calle de los Reyes near Plaza de España, is the high-concept sibling of the legendary Hola Coffee. While the review frames it as a "de toda la vida" spot, Misión is actually a textbook example of the technical, third-wave specialty movement. Its industrial-minimalist design—featuring light woods, exposed walls, and a sunken open kitchen—is more clinical laboratory than cozy neighborhood tavern. It is an aesthetic powerhouse that functions as a serious destination for those who view coffee as a science rather than a mere commodity.

## The Setup

The operational utility of Misión for remote workers has shifted significantly. While it remains a favorite for the "cool" freelancer crowd, the venue now enforces a strict **"No Laptops on Weekends"** policy. During the week, your productivity is geographically restricted; laptop use is typically limited to the **five-seater bar** or the "stadium-style" bleacher seating.

If you attempt to occupy one of the main dining tables with a device, expect a polite but firm redirection. The space is kitted with a few accessible outlets near these designated zones, but they are high-demand. The optimal strategy is a morning sprint (pre-11:00 AM) or a late afternoon session. By lunchtime, the smell of the open kitchen and the social hum of the brunch crowd make deep focus a struggle.

## The Coffee

The technical execution at Misión is peerless, utilizing beans roasted by Hola Coffee. The "Barista Breakfast" (a combination of a white coffee and an espresso) is the professional choice for a high-caffeine start. Beyond the liquid, Misión differentiates itself with a high-end, in-house bakery.

The **cinnamon rolls** (often topped with a seasonal cheesy cream) are legendary, though the original review’s mention of "churros" is a local misidentification—this kitchen prioritizes high-concept bakes like pastrami sandwiches, miso-butter toast, and fermented sourdough. The "Korean Latte" (infused with Gochujang) serves as a counter-perspective for those bored of the standard flat white. It is a menu designed to create tension between traditional breakfast expectations and modern culinary innovation.

## The Verdict

Misión Café is a top-tier specialty node that demands professional etiquette from its remote-working guests. It is not a generic "office-away-from-home"; it is a product-first venue that tolerates digital work only within specific spatial and temporal boundaries. It outclasses the "hipster nonsense" of Malasaña by providing a technically superior product and a more disciplined environment. If you need a communal table and zero rules, look elsewhere; if you want the best filter coffee in Madrid and don't mind working from a bar stool, Misión is a cornerstone of the city's specialty map.

**Security Note:** The sunken kitchen and tiered seating create unique blind spots. Keep your hardware physically secured and utilize a VPN on the shared network, as it is a high-traffic destination for both locals and international digital nomads.
