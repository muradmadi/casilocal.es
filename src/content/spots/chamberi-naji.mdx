## First Impressions
Naji, tucked away on a quiet street in Chamberí, is a breath of fresh air compared to the overcrowded cafes in Malasaña. This barrio is de toda la vida, with its picturesque plazas and historic buildings, and Naji fits right in with its understated charm. As I walked in, I was greeted by the owners, who take pride in their craft, and the aroma of expertly brewed coffee. It's a place where you can escape the chaos of nearby Plaza de Chamberí and enjoy a peaceful moment to yourself.

## The Setup
The workspace at Naji is cozy, with a few small tables and a bar that's perfect for sipping a caña or enjoying a café con leche. The seating area is limited, but the outdoor terraza is a lovely spot to work on a sunny day. Be aware that there are only a few outlets, strategically placed near the bar, so it's best to come prepared with a portable charger. The wifi is reliable, but not lightning-fast, so it's suitable for browsing or sending emails, but maybe not for video conferencing. If you're looking for a spot to work during the post-siesta rush, Naji is a good choice, but avoid la hora del vermut, when the cafe can get crowded with locals enjoying a pre-dinner drink.

## The Coffee
Naji's coffee is, without a doubt, some of the best in the city. The owners source high-quality beans and take the time to carefully craft each drink. The menu is simple, but the execution is flawless. I recommend the cortado, which is rich and creamy, or the pour-over, which is a masterclass in balance and flavor. Skip the sandwiches and pastries, which are decent but not exceptional, and focus on the coffee, which is the real star of the show.

## The Verdict
Naji is a hidden gem in Chamberí, perfect for remote workers who value good coffee and a peaceful atmosphere. While it may not have all the amenities of a larger coworking space, it's a great spot to come and work for a few hours, especially during the week. Unlike the tourist traps near Sol, Naji is a genuine, local spot that's worth seeking out. So, if you're looking for a cafe that's a cut above the usual Madrileño fare, head to Naji and experience the best of Chamberí's laid-back charm. Just don't forget your portable charger, and be prepared to fall in love with their exceptional coffee.
