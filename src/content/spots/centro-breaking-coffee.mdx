## First Impressions
Breaking Coffee in Centro is a breath of fresh air, tucked away on a quiet street just a stone's throw from the lively Plaza de la Villa. Unlike the tourist traps near Sol, this cafe has a genuine, de toda la vida vibe that's hard to find in the heart of the city. As I walked in, I was greeted by the friendly staff and the aroma of expertly brewed coffee, a welcome respite from the chaos of the nearby Calle Mayor. The cozy interior, with its sleek decor and comfortable seating, immediately made me feel at home.

## The Setup
The workspace at Breaking Coffee is well-suited for remote workers, with plenty of natural light pouring in through the large windows and a comfortable seating area that's perfect for settling in with a laptop. The tables are spacious, with ample room to spread out, and the chairs are surprisingly comfortable, making it easy to spend hours working away. As for plugs, there are plenty of outlets located throughout the cafe, including a few conveniently placed near the window seats, perfect for keeping your devices charged while you work. One tip: try to avoid coming during la hora del vermut (around 1-3 pm), when the cafe can get busy with locals popping in for a quick caña or coffee before lunch.

## The Coffee
The coffee at Breaking Coffee is, without a doubt, some of the best in the city. Their specialty coffee drinks are creative and expertly crafted, with unique flavors like pistachio coconut coffee that's definitely worth trying. The baristas are knowledgeable and happy to offer recommendations, and the coffee is always made with high-quality, freshly roasted beans. If you're feeling peckish, the cookies and pastries are also delicious, although I'd recommend skipping the somewhat bland sandwich offerings and sticking to the sweet treats.

## The Verdict
Overall, Breaking Coffee is a fantastic spot for remote workers, with its welcoming atmosphere, excellent coffee, and comfortable workspace. While it may not be the cheapest option in the city, the quality of the coffee and the friendly service make it well worth the extra cost. Just be sure to come early, before the post-siesta rush, to grab a seat on the terraza and enjoy the lively atmosphere of the surrounding neighborhood. With its unique blend of style, substance, and Spanish charm, Breaking Coffee is a must-visit destination for anyone looking for a great cup of coffee in the heart of Madrid.
