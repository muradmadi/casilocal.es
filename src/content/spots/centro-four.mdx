## First Impressions
Four cafe in Centro is a breath of fresh air, tucked away on a quiet street just a stone's throw from the bustling Puerta del Sol. Unlike the tourist traps that line the Gran Vía, Four cafe feels like a local secret, a hidden gem that's been "de toda la vida" - a part of the neighborhood's fabric for years. As you step inside, you're greeted by the warm glow of natural light pouring in through the large windows, and the sleek, minimalist decor that's more Scandinavian chic than Madrid kitsch.

## The Setup
The workspace at Four cafe is thoughtfully designed, with plenty of outlets strategically located near the comfortable seating areas. You'll find a large communal table near the back, perfect for spreading out your laptop and notes, and plenty of smaller tables by the window for a more intimate setup. The wifi is fast and reliable, making it easy to stay productive during the post-siesta rush or while avoiding the chaos of "la hora del vermut" on a Friday evening. Just be aware that the cafe can get a bit busy around 11am, when the local crowd comes in for their café con leche and a quick catch-up with friends.

## The Coffee
The coffee at Four cafe is top-notch, with a rotating selection of specialty beans from local roasters. The baristas are knowledgeable and passionate about their craft, happy to guide you through the menu and recommend the perfect cup to suit your taste. Be sure to try the cortado, expertly balanced and rich, and pair it with a delicious pastry or toast from the cafe's selection. And if you're feeling thirsty after a long morning of work, grab a cold caña from the fridge and enjoy it on the terraza out front, watching the world go by on the charming street.

## The Verdict
Overall, Four cafe is a standout spot in Centro, a neighborhood that's often overwhelmed by tourists and chain stores. With its unique blend of style, substance, and local charm, it's the perfect place to settle in for a productive day of work, or simply to enjoy a great cup of coffee and a moment of peace in the heart of the city. So skip the overpriced cafes on the Gran Vía and head to Four cafe instead - your taste buds, and your wallet, will thank you. With a casi score of 9, Four cafe is a must-visit for any remote worker or digital nomad looking for a authentic Madrid experience.
