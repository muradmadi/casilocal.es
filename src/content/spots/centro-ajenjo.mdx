## First Impressions
Ajenjo, tucked away in a quiet corner of Centro, is a breath of fresh air compared to the overcrowded cafes on Gran Vía. This de toda la vida spot has been a staple in the neighborhood for years, and its unassuming exterior belies a warm and inviting atmosphere within. As I push open the door, I'm greeted by the familiar aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the gentle hum of conversation - a welcome respite from the chaos of nearby Puerta del Sol.

## The Setup
The interior of Ajenjo is a masterclass in understated elegance, with dark wood accents and comfortable seating that's perfect for lingering over a caña or a café con leche. While it's not the most spacious cafe, there are a few tables near the window that are ideal for remote workers, with easy access to power outlets and a relatively quiet atmosphere. Be sure to arrive before the post-siesta rush, when the terraza fills up with locals catching up on the latest gossip, to snag a spot with a decent view of the street. And don't even think about coming during la hora del vermut - unless you're looking to join the lively crowd of locals sipping on vermouth and munching on tapas.

## The Coffee
Ajenjo's coffee is, without a doubt, some of the best in the city. Their expertly pulled shots are made with high-quality beans, and the baristas are always happy to offer a recommendation or two. The menu is simple, but the execution is flawless - whether you're in the mood for a strong espresso or a more laid-back café con leche. And if you're feeling peckish, their selection of traditional Spanish pastries is the perfect accompaniment to your morning coffee.

## The Verdict
While Ajenjo may not be the most obvious choice for remote workers, it's a hidden gem that's well worth seeking out. With its warm atmosphere, excellent coffee, and convenient location, it's an ideal spot to spend a few hours working or meeting with clients. Just be sure to bring cash, as they don't accept credit or debit cards - a minor inconvenience in an otherwise exceptional cafe. And if you're looking for a truly authentic Madrid experience, skip the tourist traps near Sol and head to Ajenjo instead. You won't be disappointed.
