## First Impressions
I've spent years navigating the cafe scene in Centro, and Alchemy is a gem that's managed to fly under the radar. Tucked away on a side street near Plaza de la Puerta del Sol, this spot is a welcome respite from the overpriced tourist traps that line Calle de la Princesa. As I walked in, I was greeted by the aroma of expertly roasted coffee beans and the warm glow of the terraza-style seating area, which instantly made me feel like I was in a de toda la vida Madrid cafe. The vibe is distinctly local, with Spanish being spoken by the regulars and the baristas, and the decor has a hip, yet unpretentious feel to it - no pretentious Malasaña-esque fixie bikes or vintage decor here.

## The Setup
The seating area is cozy, with a few small tables and a bar-like seating area that's perfect for solo workers or small meetings. I've found that the back corner is your best bet for a reliable outlet, and the Wi-Fi is solid and fast - no lag or dropped connections to speak of. It's not the largest space, but it's well-designed and comfortable, with big windows that let in plenty of natural light. Just be aware that it can get busy during the post-siesta rush, especially on weekdays - if you can, try to come in before la hora del vermut (around 1-3 pm) when the locals are out grabbing a caña or two. If you're looking for a quiet spot to focus, avoid the 11am café con leche crowd, when the place fills up with locals taking a break from shopping on Calle de Fuencarral.

## The Coffee
Now, onto the good stuff: the coffee. Alchemy's flat white is a game-changer - rich, creamy, and with just the right amount of acidity. They also offer a rotating selection of guest beans, which is a nice touch for coffee aficionados. I'm not a huge fan of their pour-over, but hey, it's still a decent cup. And if you're feeling peckish, the cakes and cookies are more than just an afterthought - they're actually worth snacking on. The baristas are friendly and knowledgeable, happy to chat about the different beans and roasts they're working with. If you're a coffee snob like me, you'll appreciate the attention to detail they bring to every cup.

## The Verdict
All in all, Alchemy is a top-notch spot for remote workers in Madrid. With its expertly crafted coffee, reliable Wi-Fi, and cozy atmosphere, it's a great place to get some work done - and it's conveniently located near plenty of other great spots in Centro, from the lively Mercado de San Miguel to the charming Plaza de Santa Ana. Unlike the usual tourist traps near Sol, Alchemy feels genuinely Madrileño, with a laid-back vibe that's perfect for a productive afternoon. So, if you're looking for a spot to call your own in the heart of the city, Alchemy is definitely worth checking out - just don't forget to order a café con leche and grab a seat on the terraza to soak up the Centro vibe. ¡Vale la pena!
