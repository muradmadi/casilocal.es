## First Impressions
Miles, tucked away in a quiet corner of Centro, is a breath of fresh air compared to the chaotic cafes that line the streets of Sol. This charming spot, with its understated facade, is easy to miss, but trust me, it's worth seeking out. As a local, I've had my fair share of coffee at the usual suspects in Malasaña and La Latina, but Miles has quickly become my go-to spot for a quiet morning coffee or an afternoon pick-me-up. The 11am café con leche crowd is always a good indicator of a cafe's quality, and Miles passes with flying colors.

## The Setup
The interior of Miles is cozy, with a handful of small tables and a bar that's perfect for solo workers or a casual meet-up with friends. The seating area is equipped with plenty of outlets, conveniently located near the windows, making it easy to plug in and stay charged. The terraza, although small, is a lovely spot to enjoy a caña or a coffee on a warm day, and it's a great place to people-watch and take in the sights and sounds of the neighborhood. Unlike some of the more hipster cafes in the area, Miles doesn't try too hard to be trendy, and the atmosphere is all the better for it.

## The Coffee
The coffee at Miles is top-notch, with a rotating selection of specialty beans and expertly crafted pour-overs. The baristas are knowledgeable and happy to guide you through the menu, which also features a selection of delicious baked goods and light bites. The coffee is strong, but not bitter, and the flavors are nuanced and complex. As a fan of a good café con leche, I can attest that Miles serves one of the best in the city. Be sure to order the "torta de aceite" to accompany your coffee - it's a classic Spanish treat that's de toda la vida.

## The Verdict
Overall, Miles is a hidden gem in the heart of Centro, and it's a must-visit for any remote worker or coffee aficionado. The best time to come is during the post-siesta rush, when the cafe is bustling but not crowded, and the atmosphere is lively but focused. Avoid coming during "la hora del vermut" (around 1-3 pm), when the cafe can get a bit noisy and crowded. With its excellent coffee, comfortable seating, and convenient location, Miles is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a reliable workspace or a casual spot to meet with friends. It's a true Madrid cafe, with all the charm and character that comes with it, and it's a great alternative to the more touristy spots in the area.
