## First Impressions

Feliz Coffee (specifically the "To Stay" location on Calle de Lope de Vega) is a masterclass in modern "slow coffee" culture. Tucked away in the historic Barrio de las Letras, it sits as a quiet, bright alternative to the chaotic tourist thoroughfares of nearby Calle de la Princesa and Sol. The aesthetic is clinical yet warm—bright, clean lines and a professional demeanor that signals a focus on the craft of roasting rather than the volume of traffic.

## The Setup

Contrary to outdated reviews suggesting this is a remote-work haven, Feliz has pivoted toward a **strictly laptop-free environment**. The current operational logic is designed to foster a "relaxed break" rather than a workday.

The seating is petite and cozy, with a few small tables and a bright interior that catches natural light, but the management explicitly discourages digital distractions. While you may see older notes about window-side outlets, these are functionally obsolete for workers, as the venue now promotes a "To Stay" philosophy that revolves around social interaction or reading. If you are looking for a spot to open a MacBook, you will likely be politely redirected or find yourself without a connection, as the Wi-Fi is either restricted or entirely absent to preserve the "unplugged" vibe.

## The Coffee

The coffee program remains the primary reason for the venue’s prestige. This is a technical specialty shop where the baristas—fluent in both Spanish and English—treat extractions with high precision. The Flat White and Cortado are the benchmark drinks here, featuring perfectly micro-foamed milk (including high-quality almond milk alternatives) and balanced specialty profiles.

The food menu is concise but high-quality, focused on premium pastries like *pain au chocolat*, cinnamon rolls, and date rolls. While the original review suggests skipping the *caña*, it’s worth noting that the venue’s focus is so intensely on caffeine that alcohol is practically a non-factor. This is a place for serious coffee practitioners and those looking to decompress, not for a working lunch.

## The Verdict

Feliz Coffee is an exceptional specialty destination, but it is an **operational dead zone** for remote workers. It has intentionally decoupled itself from the "laptop-friendly" ecosystem to protect its atmosphere. It is the premier spot for a mid-day sensory reset or a quiet meeting without screens. If you need to hit a deadline, go to a designated coworking hub; come to Feliz only when you are ready to close the laptop and appreciate one of the best extractions in Madrid.

**Security Note:** As a high-foot-traffic specialty boutique, keep your belongings close. Since laptop use is discouraged, your hardware should remain out of sight to respect the house rules.
