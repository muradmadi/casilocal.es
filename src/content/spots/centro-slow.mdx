## First Impressions
Slow cafe in Centro is a hidden gem that's easy to miss, nestled between the bustling streets of Calle de la Luna and Calle de los Carmelitas. Unlike the tourist traps near Sol, this spot exudes a relaxed, de toda la vida vibe that's perfect for a casual breakfast or coffee. The beautifully decorated space, with its minimalist decor and plenty of natural light, is a welcome respite from the chaos of the city. I've lived in Madrid for years, and I can confidently say that Slow cafe is a great alternative to the usual Malasaña hipster nonsense.

## The Setup
As a remote worker, I was pleased to find that Slow cafe has a decent setup for productivity. The seating area is spacious, with plenty of outlets located near the windows and along the walls. The best spot to grab is near the large window on Calle de los Carmelitas, where you can people-watch and enjoy the street performers. The wifi is fast and reliable, making it an ideal spot to get some work done. However, be aware that the cafe can get busy during the 11am café con leche crowd and the post-siesta rush, so it's best to come early or later in the day to avoid the noise.

## The Coffee
The coffee at Slow cafe is top-notch, with a variety of specialty drinks to choose from. I highly recommend the cortado, which is made with high-quality beans and expertly crafted by the baristas. The cafe also offers a selection of delicious pastries and sandwiches, including a mean tortilla de patatas. If you're looking for a snack to accompany your coffee, skip the croissants and opt for the freshly baked muffins instead. And if you're feeling thirsty, grab a caña from the bar and enjoy it on the terraza out front.

## The Verdict
Overall, Slow cafe is a great spot for remote workers who want to experience the authentic Madrid vibe. With its relaxed atmosphere, fast wifi, and excellent coffee, it's an ideal spot to get some work done or simply enjoy a quiet morning coffee. Just be aware of the busy times and plan your visit accordingly. As a local, I can confidently say that Slow cafe is a gem in the heart of Centro, and it's definitely worth a visit. With a casi score of 8, it's a solid choice for anyone looking for a productive and enjoyable spot to work or relax in Madrid.
