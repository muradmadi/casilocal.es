## First Impressions
Le Praliné, tucked away on a side street in Malasaña, is a breath of fresh air compared to the usual hipster nonsense that plagues this barrio. As a local, I've grown tired of the overly-trendy cafes that seem to prioritize aesthetics over substance, but Le Praliné strikes a perfect balance between style and quality. From the outside, it looks like a quaint, de toda la vida café, but step inside and you'll find a modern, Instagram-worthy interior that's sure to impress. The aroma of freshly baked pastries wafts through the air, making it impossible to resist the urge to order something delicious.

## The Setup
The workspace at Le Praliné is surprisingly conducive to productivity, with ample seating and plenty of outlets to go around. The plugs are conveniently located near the window seats, perfect for catching a glimpse of the bustling street life on Calle de la Luna while you work. The seating area is cozy, with comfortable chairs and spacious tables that can accommodate laptops, notebooks, and a caña or two. Be mindful of the 11am café con leche crowd, as it can get busy, but the post-siesta rush is usually a good time to grab a seat and get some work done. Just be sure to avoid la hora del vermut, when the cafe fills up with locals sipping on vermouth and snacking on tapas.

## The Coffee
The coffee at Le Praliné is, in a word, exceptional. Their specialty coffee drinks are crafted with care, and the presentation is almost too beautiful to disturb. Almost. The baristas are knowledgeable and happy to guide you through the menu, which features a range of unique flavor blends and expertly pulled shots. I recommend ordering the cortado, which is rich and creamy, and pairing it with a delicious pastry or snack. The food menu is equally impressive, with dishes like tortilla de patatas and croissants that are almost too good to be true.

## The Verdict
In a neighborhood filled with cafes, Le Praliné stands out as a true gem. Unlike the tourist traps near Sol, this cafe feels like a genuine, local spot, where you can grab a great cup of coffee, a bite to eat, and get some work done in a comfortable and stylish setting. As a remote worker, I appreciate the practical details, like plenty of outlets and a quiet atmosphere, but it's the little things, like the friendly staff and the beautiful presentation of the food and drinks, that make Le Praliné a truly special place. Whether you're a local or just passing through, this cafe is definitely worth a visit – just be sure to come back and explore the rest of what Malasaña has to offer, from the street art on Calle de la Palma to the lively terrazas on Plaza del Dos de Mayo.
