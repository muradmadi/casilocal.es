## First Impressions
J And J'S Books in Malasaña is a breath of fresh air in a barrio that's increasingly being taken over by hipster nonsense. Tucked away on a quiet street just off the bustling Calle de Fuencarral, this cafe is a de toda la vida spot that's perfect for a morning café con leche or a post-siesta coffee break. Unlike the tourist traps near Sol, J And J'S Books feels like a genuine Malasaña experience, with its eclectic decor and laid-back vibe that's reminiscent of the neighborhood's infamous alternative spirit.

## The Setup
The workspace at J And J'S Books is cozy, with a few small tables and a comfy sofa in the back that's perfect for curling up with a book or a laptop. The seating area is surrounded by floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, adding to the cafe's literary charm. In terms of practicalities, there are plenty of power outlets to go around, with a few strategically located near the windows and a long table in the back that's perfect for plugging in and getting some work done. The wifi is reliable, if not lightning-fast, and the staff are happy to provide a password for those looking to stay a while.

## The Coffee
The coffee at J And J'S Books is top-notch, with a selection of specialty brews that are sure to please even the most discerning coffee snobs. The cafe con leche is rich and creamy, and the cortado is expertly balanced. The baristas are knowledgeable and friendly, happy to chat about everything from coffee beans to the latest literary releases. For remote workers, it's best to avoid the 11am café con leche crowd and the post-siesta rush, when the cafe can get a bit busy. Instead, try coming in around 3pm, when the atmosphere is more relaxed and you can snag a seat on the terraza and enjoy a caña or two.

## The Verdict
Overall, J And J'S Books is a hidden gem in Malasaña that's perfect for remote workers, book lovers, and anyone looking for a genuine Madrid experience. With its unique atmosphere, excellent coffee, and practical setup, it's a great alternative to the usual hipster cafes that dominate the neighborhood. Just be sure to avoid the busy hours and don't skip the tortilla de patatas, which is one of the best in the city. Whether you're looking for a spot to work, read, or simply enjoy a quiet coffee, J And J'S Books is a must-visit destination in Malasaña.
