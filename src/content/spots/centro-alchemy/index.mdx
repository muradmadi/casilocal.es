## First Impressions

Alchemy is a tactical anomaly in the Centro district. Positioned near the high-traffic corridor of Puerta del Sol, it manages to maintain a "neighborhood" gravity that its neighbors have long since lost to commercial tourism. The space avoids the stereotypical "hipster" tropes—there are no hanging fixie bikes or manufactured industrial grit here. Instead, it offers a warm, plant-heavy, and unpretentious environment that feels genuinely Madrileño. It is a "de toda la vida" spot reimagined through the lens of modern specialty standards.

## The Setup

The physical layout is compact and requires strategic timing. The seating is a mix of small tables and a bar-style counter, catering primarily to solo workers or duos. For those with high battery-drain workflows, the rear corner is the only viable station, as it houses the most reliable power outlets.

Operationally, Alchemy is an "early bird" or "late hitter" location. Between 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM, the space is often overwhelmed by the local shopping crowd from Calle de Fuencarral, making deep focus difficult. The optimal window for productivity is the "pre-vermut" lull (before 1:00 PM) or the late afternoon. The Wi-Fi is notably robust—unlike many local cafes that throttle bandwidth, Alchemy provides a stable connection capable of handling heavy-duty remote tasks without dropouts.

## The Coffee

The technical backbone of Alchemy is their Slayer espresso machine, which they use to pull some of the most consistent shots in the district. The flat white is the benchmark here: rich, micro-foamed to perfection, and balanced in acidity. For the more analytical drinker, they offer a rotating guest bean program and technical V60 pour-overs, though the milk-based drinks are where their consistency truly shines.

Unlike many specialty shops where the food is an afterthought, Alchemy’s selection of homemade cakes and cookies (particularly the pistachio cookies) is worth the caloric investment. The baristas are practitioners of the craft—knowledgeable, bilingual, and willing to discuss roast profiles without the typical elitism found in Malasaña.

## The Verdict

Alchemy is a premier "base camp" for remote workers who need to stay within striking distance of Sol without sacrificing technical coffee quality or digital connectivity. It is a high-utility space that rewards those who understand the local rhythm. While it lacks the expansive square footage of a dedicated coworking hub, its reliable internet and superior caffeine make it a superior alternative to any nearby "tourist-trap" chains. It is a genuine piece of the city center that remains functional for the professional.

**Security Note:** While the Wi-Fi is fast, it is a shared public network. Use a VPN for all professional data transmissions and remain aware of your hardware in this high-foot-traffic area.
