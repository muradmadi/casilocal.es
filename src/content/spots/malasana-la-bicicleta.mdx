## First Impressions
La Bicicleta, tucked away on a side street in Malasaña, is a breath of fresh air compared to the usual hipster nonsense that plagues this barrio. As a local, I've grown tired of the overly trendy cafes that seem to pop up overnight, only to disappear just as quickly. But La Bicicleta feels like a "de toda la vida" kind of place - the kind of spot where you can grab a café con leche and a caña at 11am, and still be surrounded by the charming chaos of Malasaña. The exterior is understated, with a small terraza that's perfect for people-watching on a warm afternoon.

## The Setup
Inside, the workspace is well-laid out, with plenty of plugs and comfortable seating. The large table near the window is a great spot to set up your laptop, and the staff is more than happy to accommodate remote workers. Unlike some of the other cafes in the area, La Bicicleta doesn't feel cramped or cluttered, making it easy to focus on your work. The wifi is reliable, and the noise level is pleasant - not too loud, not too quiet. Just be sure to avoid the post-siesta rush, when the cafe can get a bit crowded with locals grabbing a quick pick-me-up before heading back to work.

## The Coffee
The coffee at La Bicicleta is excellent, with a wide range of specialty drinks to choose from. The baristas are knowledgeable and passionate about their craft, and it shows in every cup. I'm a big fan of their cortado, which is rich and creamy without being overpowering. The food, on the other hand, is decent but not spectacular - stick to the toast or pastries, and skip the more substantial dishes. And if you're looking for a quiet spot to work, be sure to avoid "la hora del vermut" (around 1-3pm), when the cafe can get a bit lively with locals grabbing a pre-lunch drink.

## The Verdict
Overall, La Bicicleta is a great spot for remote workers, with a winning combination of good coffee, comfortable seating, and a pleasant atmosphere. It's a great alternative to the tourist traps near Sol, and a more laid-back option than some of the other cafes in Malasaña. With its convenient location, reliable wifi, and friendly staff, La Bicicleta is definitely worth considering for those looking for a productive spot in Madrid. Just be sure to come early, or be prepared to wait for a table - this place is popular with locals, and for good reason.
