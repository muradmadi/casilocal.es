## First Impressions

Hola Coffee, located on the street of art galleries (Calle del Dr. Fourquet), is a pioneer in Madrid's third-wave scene. It avoids the "historical kitsch" of Lavapiés in favor of a bright, minimalist, and almost industrial aesthetic. Founded by champion baristas, the space signals a "product-first" mentality. It is a high-ceilinged, airy venue that manages to feel both like a neighborhood secret and a global coffee destination, removing you from the tourist stream of nearby Museo Reina Sofía.

## The Setup

The operational reality for remote workers at Hola is one of "conditional hospitality." While it is frequently cited as laptop-friendly, the space has tightened its boundaries to prioritize social turnover.

The seating is functional—think small wooden tables and benches—but lacks the ergonomic support for an eight-hour shift. There is no longer a "free-for-all" on laptops; the staff often enforces a **two-hour limit** during busy periods, and like many specialty spots in the area, weekend working is increasingly discouraged to accommodate brunch crowds. Outlets are sparse and strategically hidden. The best tactical window for work is between 8:30 AM and 11:00 AM on weekdays. If you plan to stay longer, expect to rotate your orders frequently or be politely asked to make room for "paying clients."

## The Coffee

Technical execution is where Hola remains a market leader. As a dedicated roastery, their extractions are surgical. The café con leche is consistently superior, featuring high-fidelity milk texture and beans roasted in-house.

For the analytical drinker, the batch brew and seasonal pour-overs are the real draw. The food menu is concise but high-value: the **cinnamon rolls** are widely considered some of the best in Spain—doughy, frosted, and technically sound. They also offer inventive options like "blueberry matcha" and "olive oil iced lattes," signaling a willingness to experiment that keeps the menu from feeling static.

## The Verdict

Hola Coffee is a technical powerhouse that is only "50% laptop-friendly." It is a superior spot for a high-intensity 90-minute work session or a creative meeting, but it is not a coworking surrogate. The "miserable barista" trope occasionally mentioned in reviews is often just a reflection of the shop's focus on professional efficiency over casual lounging. If you need a silent office with unlimited power, go elsewhere; if you want the best caffeine in Lavapiés to fuel a quick sprint, this is the benchmark.

**Security Note:** The open-door policy and high turnover on Dr. Fourquet make it a risk for unattended hardware. Keep your devices within reach and use a VPN on the shared network.
