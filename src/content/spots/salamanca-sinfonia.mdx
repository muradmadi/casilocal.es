## The Vibe
Sinfonía is a charming cafe in the Goya area of Madrid, known for its specialty coffees and tasty food. The atmosphere is lovely, with a pleasant buzz that's suitable for a casual work session. However, the noise level can get high when it's crowded, making it less ideal for meetings or focused work. The staff is friendly and welcoming, with a few mentioning that they speak English.
## The Verdict
As a spot for remote workers, Sinfonía has its pros and cons. On the plus side, the coffee is outstanding, and they have lactose-free milk options. The food looks amazing, although some reviewers found it a bit pricey. The main downside is that the wifi is only available upon request, and you can only work for a maximum of 2 hours. With no mention of power outlets, it's not the most suitable spot for a long workday. Overall, Sinfonía is a good choice for a few hours of solo work or a casual meeting, but it's not the best fit for those who need a reliable workspace for an extended period.
