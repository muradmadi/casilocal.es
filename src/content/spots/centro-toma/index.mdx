## First Impressions
Toma cafe in Centro is a gem tucked away on a quiet street, just a stone's throw from the bustling Puerta del Sol. As a local, I've watched this cafe evolve, and I must say, it's a welcome respite from the chaos of the city center. Unlike the tourist traps near Sol, Toma exudes a cozy, de toda la vida vibe that's hard to find in this part of town. The exterior is unassuming, but step inside, and you'll be greeted by a charming interior that's equal parts stylish and inviting.

## The Setup
The workspace at Toma is snug, with a few small tables and a bar that's perfect for sipping a caña or working on your laptop. The seating area is equipped with a few outlets, conveniently located near the window seats, which offer a pleasant view of the street. However, be warned: the wifi can be spotty, and the staff might give you a strange look if you try to plug in your laptop during la hora del vermut (yes, they take their vermouth hour seriously here). If you're looking to get some work done, I recommend avoiding the post-siesta rush (around 4-5 pm) and opting for a quieter morning slot, like 11 am, when the café con leche crowd is still sipping their coffee.

## The Coffee
Toma's coffee is, without a doubt, one of the highlights of this cafe. Their specialty coffee selection is impressive, with options like Bolivian and Indian espresso that will satisfy even the most discerning coffee connoisseur. The baristas are knowledgeable and passionate about their craft, and it shows in every cup. Pair your coffee with one of their delicious pastries, like the croissant or the torta de aceite, and you're in for a treat. Just be sure to skip the burnt food (yes, it's a thing here) and opt for something freshly baked.

## The Verdict
As a remote worker, Toma cafe is a solid choice, but it's not without its quirks. The inconsistent service and spotty wifi might be a turn-off for some, but if you're looking for a charming, laid-back spot to get some work done, Toma is worth a try. Just be sure to respect the local customs (no laptops during vermouth hour, por favor) and enjoy the relaxed atmosphere. And if you're feeling adventurous, take a stroll around the neighborhood, which is full of hidden gems, from the historic Plaza Mayor to the trendy Calle de la Luna. With its unique blend of old and new, Centro is a barrio that's full of character, and Toma cafe is a great place to experience it.
