## First Impressions

Despacito is a strategic refuge in the high-density chaos of Callao. Located on Calle de Jacometrezo—literally a stone's throw from the hyper-commercial Puerta del Sol—it functions as an operational oasis. Unlike the generic franchise traps nearby, Despacito maintains a "de toda la vida" soul, blended with modern specialty standards. The decor strikes a balance between trendy and utilitarian, featuring a small street-side terraza that provides a front-row seat to the city's friction without the sensory overwhelm of the main plazas.

## The Setup

For the remote professional, Despacito is one of the more frictionless options in Centro. The workspace logic is highly inclusive; power outlets are distributed generously along the perimeter walls and integrated beneath the bar seating.

The seating configuration is versatile, accommodating both solo "deep work" stations and larger tables for collaborative sessions. However, the space is subject to the local rhythm: arriving after 4:00 PM puts you in direct competition with the post-siesta rush. The Wi-Fi is a standout feature for the area—robust, consistent, and capable of handling more than just light email browsing. It is one of the few spots in this tourist-heavy quadrant where you can actually maintain a professional digital presence.

## The Coffee

The coffee program is a disciplined specialty operation. Utilizing high-quality, locally roasted beans, the extractions are precise and technically sound. The café con leche is the standard-bearer here, featuring micro-foam that holds its structure and a flavor profile that leans toward chocolatey, balanced notes rather than aggressive acidity.

The food menu serves as a functional companion to the caffeine. The croissants are technically superior to standard bakery fare—buttery, flaky, and consistently fresh. A tactical tip: avoid the 1:00 PM "vermut window" unless you are transitioning to an analog lunch. During this time, the space pivots to a local social hub, making screen-based concentration significantly more difficult.

## The Verdict

Despacito is a high-utility asset for remote workers needing a base of operations in the center of Madrid. It outclasses the "hipster" hubs of Malasaña by offering a more grounded, less performative environment. It is an ideal spot for those who need reliable infrastructure—power, internet, and high-grade caffeine—without the pretense of a dedicated coworking space. If your itinerary requires a productive afternoon within walking distance of Sol, Despacito is the premier choice.

**Security Note:** Given its proximity to Callao and the high foot traffic on Jacometrezo, maintain high situational awareness regarding your hardware. Ensure all devices are tethered or within reach, especially if sitting near the entrance or on the terraza.
