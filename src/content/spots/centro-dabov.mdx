## First Impressions
Dabov, tucked away in a quiet street of Centro, is a breath of fresh air compared to the overpriced, soulless cafes that plague the area around Sol. As a local, I've grown tired of the same old tourist traps, so it's refreshing to find a spot that caters to the discerning coffee lover. The exterior is unassuming, but the interior is sleek and modern, with a hint of industrial chic that's all the rage in Madrid these days. It's a far cry from the traditional, de toda la vida cafes that line the Calle de la Cava Baja, but it's a welcome addition to the neighborhood.

## The Setup
The workspace at Dabov is well-suited for remote workers, with plenty of natural light pouring in through the large windows and a comfortable seating area that's perfect for settling in with a laptop. The tables are spacious, and the chairs are sturdy, making it an ideal spot to spend a few hours working. As for outlets, you'll find them conveniently located near the windows, so you can plug in and enjoy the view of the street outside. The wifi is reliable, and the staff is happy to provide the password, so you can stay connected and productive. Just be sure to avoid the post-siesta rush, when the cafe fills up with locals looking for a caña or a coffee to revive themselves.

## The Coffee
The coffee at Dabov is, without a doubt, the main event. The baristas are knowledgeable and passionate, with a clear love for their craft that shines through in every cup. The specialty coffee selection is impressive, with a range of options to suit every taste. I recommend the pour-over, which is expertly brewed and full of nuanced flavors. The pastries and snacks are also worth trying, particularly the delicious croissants that are perfect for accompanying your morning coffee. Unlike some of the more hipster cafes in Malasaña, Dabov doesn't skimp on quality, and the prices are reasonable to boot.

## The Verdict
In short, Dabov is a gem of a cafe that's perfect for remote workers and coffee aficionados alike. While it may not have the terraza of some of the more traditional cafes in the area, the interior is comfortable and welcoming, and the staff is always happy to chat about the latest coffee trends. Just be sure to come early, before the 11am café con leche crowd arrives, and avoid the chaos of la hora del vermut, when the cafe can get a bit too lively. With its excellent coffee, comfortable workspace, and convenient location, Dabov is a must-visit for anyone looking for a productive and delicious spot to work or relax in the heart of Centro.
