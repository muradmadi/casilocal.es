## First Impressions
Cafelito, tucked away on a quiet street in Centro, is a breath of fresh air compared to the tourist traps near Sol. This tiny cafe has a de toda la vida charm that's hard to find in the more hipster-dominated neighborhoods like Malasaña. As I pushed open the door, I was greeted by the friendly staff and the enticing aroma of freshly brewed coffee. The decor is minimalist, with a few small tables and a terraza that's perfect for people-watching on a sunny day.

## The Setup
The workspace at Cafelito is cozy, with a few small tables that can accommodate laptops and notebooks. The plugs are conveniently located near the windows, and the seating is comfortable, if a bit cramped. It's not the most ideal setup for a full-day work session, but it's perfect for a few hours of focused work or a casual meeting. Unlike some other cafes in the area, Cafelito doesn't seem to mind if you linger over your coffee, making it a great spot to catch up on work or meet with friends. Just be sure to avoid the 11am café con leche crowd and the post-siesta rush, when the cafe can get a bit busy.

## The Coffee
The coffee at Cafelito is top-notch, with a rich and smooth flavor that's perfect for a morning pick-me-up or an afternoon boost. The baristas are knowledgeable and happy to recommend a coffee to suit your taste. I opted for a café con leche, which was expertly prepared and presented with a charming smile. The pastries and snacks are also delicious, although the selection is limited. If you're looking for a quick bite, the tortilla de patatas is a great option. Just don't expect to find any fancy or overly expensive dishes on the menu - Cafelito is all about keeping things simple and authentic.

## The Verdict
Overall, Cafelito is a hidden gem in Centro that's perfect for remote workers, digital nomads, and anyone looking for a quiet, authentic cafe experience. While it may not have all the amenities of some of the more trendy cafes, it makes up for it with its warm atmosphere, excellent coffee, and friendly staff. Just be sure to come during off-peak hours, and don't be afraid to strike up a conversation with the locals - after all, that's what Madrid is all about. And if you're feeling thirsty after a long day of work, grab a caña at one of the nearby bars and enjoy the lively nightlife of Centro.
