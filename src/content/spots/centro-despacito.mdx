## First Impressions
Despacito cafe in Centro is a hidden gem, tucked away on a quiet street just a stone's throw from the bustling Puerta del Sol. Unlike the tourist traps near Sol, Despacito has a authentic, de toda la vida vibe that's hard to find in this part of town. As I walked in, I was greeted by the friendly barista and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, which immediately made me feel at home. The decor is trendy, but not overly hipster, with a cozy terraza out front that's perfect for people-watching.

## The Setup
The workspace at Despacito is surprisingly well-suited for remote workers, with plenty of outlets located along the walls and under the bar. The seating area is comfortable, with a mix of small tables and larger ones that can accommodate groups or laptop-wielding freelancers. However, be warned: the cafe can get busy during the post-siesta rush, so it's best to arrive before 4pm to snag a good spot. And, unlike some other cafes in the area, Despacito actually has reliable wifi, which is a must for anyone looking to get some work done.

## The Coffee
The coffee at Despacito is top-notch, with a variety of specialty drinks made from high-quality, locally-sourced beans. I opted for a café con leche, which was expertly prepared and presented with a delightful design on top. The pastries are also worth trying, particularly the croissants, which are flaky and buttery. One tip: avoid coming during la hora del vermut (around 1pm), when the cafe can get crowded with locals grabbing a quick caña and tapas before lunch.

## The Verdict
Overall, Despacito is a fantastic spot for remote workers and coffee lovers alike. It's better than the usual Malasaña hipster nonsense, with a more laid-back, local vibe that's hard to find in the city center. The combination of good coffee, comfortable seating, and reliable wifi makes it an ideal spot to get some work done or simply enjoy a leisurely breakfast. Just be sure to arrive at the right time, and don't be afraid to order a caña or two to blend in with the locals. With its unique character and excellent coffee, Despacito is definitely a spot to add to your Madrid itinerary.
