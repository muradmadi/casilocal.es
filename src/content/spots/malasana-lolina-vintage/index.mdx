## First Impressions
Lolina Vintage, tucked away on a side street in Malasaña, is a breath of fresh air compared to the usual hipster nonsense that plagues this barrio. Unlike the tourist traps near Sol, this cafe has a genuine, de toda la vida vibe that's hard to find in a city that's increasingly catering to visitors. As you step inside, you're greeted by the charming interior, complete with vintage decor and a cozy atmosphere that's perfect for a casual breakfast or a coffee break. The staff are friendly, and the music is always on point, making it a great spot to relax and unwind.

## The Setup
When it comes to getting work done, Lolina Vintage has its pros and cons. The seating area is spacious, with plenty of tables and chairs to choose from, including a lovely terraza out front that's perfect for people-watching. However, the outlet situation is a bit limited, with only a few plugs available near the windows. If you're planning on spending the day working, it's best to arrive early, before the 11am café con leche crowd descends, and snag a spot near a power source. The wifi is reliable, but not lightning-fast, so don't expect to be uploading massive files anytime soon. As for the best times to come, I'd recommend avoiding la hora del vermut (around 1-3 pm) when the cafe can get quite busy with locals grabbing a quick caña and snack before heading back to work.

## The Coffee
Lolina Vintage takes its coffee seriously, with a range of specialty drinks made from high-quality beans. The flat white is a standout, with a perfect balance of rich flavor and creamy texture. If you're feeling hungry, the cafe also serves up a mean tortilla de patatas, perfect for a snack or light lunch. Be sure to skip the overpriced sandwiches and opt for something more traditional, like a crusty baguette with tomato and olive oil. And if you're looking for a unique drink, try the cafe's signature "Lolina Latte", made with espresso, steamed milk, and a hint of vanilla.

## The Verdict
All in all, Lolina Vintage is a solid choice for remote workers looking for a charming spot to get some work done. While it may not be the most productive environment, the cafe's relaxed atmosphere and excellent coffee make it a great spot to take a break or meet with clients. Just be aware of the limited outlet situation and plan your visit accordingly. And if you're looking for a truly local experience, grab a seat on the terraza and watch the world go by, just like the Madrileños do. With its unique blend of vintage charm and modern amenities, Lolina Vintage is a must-visit for anyone looking to experience the real Malasaña.
