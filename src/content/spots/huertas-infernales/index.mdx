## First Impressions
Infernales, tucked away in the heart of Huertas, is a gem that's easy to miss but hard to forget. Unlike the tourist traps near Sol, this cafe has a de toda la vida charm that's hard to replicate. As you step in, you're greeted by the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of conversation, a far cry from the chaos of Calle de la Princesa. The interior is cozy, with dim lighting and comfortable seating that invites you to linger over a caña or a coffee.

## The Setup
As a remote worker, I'm always on the lookout for a spot with reliable wifi and ample outlets. Infernales delivers on both fronts, with sturdy wooden tables and plugs strategically placed near the windows. The seating area is spacious, with a mix of high stools and comfortable armchairs that are perfect for settling in with a laptop. The best time to come is during the post-siesta rush, when the 11am café con leche crowd has dissipated and the atmosphere is more relaxed. Avoid la hora del vermut, when the bar fills up with locals sipping on vermouth and chatting loudly.

## The Coffee
The coffee at Infernales is top-notch, with a rotating selection of specialty beans that are expertly brewed by the baristas. The cortado is a standout, with a perfect balance of rich espresso and creamy milk. The tea selection is also impressive, with a variety of herbal and black teas that are perfect for a mid-afternoon pick-me-up. Be sure to order the tortilla de patatas, which is crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, and skip the overly sweet pastries.

## The Verdict
Infernales is a hidden gem in the heart of Huertas, a neighborhood that's equal parts charming and chaotic. With its reliable wifi, comfortable seating, and expertly brewed coffee, it's a remote worker's paradise. The atmosphere is laid-back and welcoming, with a terraza that's perfect for people-watching on a warm afternoon. Better than the usual Malasaña hipster nonsense, Infernales is a genuine Madrid institution that's worth seeking out. So grab your laptop, settle in, and enjoy the ride – just be sure to arrive before la hora del vermut, when the locals take over and the party begins.
