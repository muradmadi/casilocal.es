## First Impressions
El Jardín Secreto in Conde Duque is a hidden gem that will transport you to a whimsical world, a far cry from the chaos of Sol. Tucked away on a quiet street, this charming cafe is a breath of fresh air, much like the nearby Plaza de la Luna. As you step inside, you'll be greeted by the carefully curated decor, which makes you feel like you're in a de toda la vida Madrid cafe, but with a unique twist. The cozy window alcoves and intimate atmosphere make it an ideal spot for a casual meeting or a date, but can it cater to the needs of remote workers?

## The Setup
The workspace at El Jardín Secreto is limited, but the available seating is comfortable, and the natural light pouring in through the large windows is a bonus. However, the lack of power outlets can be a major drawback for those who need to work for an extended period. There are a few outlets scattered around the cafe, but they're mostly occupied by the cafe's own equipment. If you're planning to work, it's best to arrive early, before the 11am café con leche crowd, or later in the evening, after the post-siesta rush. The terraza is a lovely spot to work, but be prepared for the occasional distraction from the passing pedestrians.

## The Coffee
The coffee at El Jardín Secreto is top-notch, with a variety of specialty coffees to choose from. The baristas are knowledgeable and passionate about their craft, and it shows in the quality of the coffee. The cafe also serves a selection of delicious pastries and sandwiches, perfect for a quick snack or lunch. If you're looking for a traditional Spanish experience, order a caña and a pincho, but if you're in the mood for something more international, their brunch options are worth trying. Avoid the busy hours, especially during la hora del vermut, when the cafe can get crowded with locals enjoying a pre-lunch drink.

## The Verdict
While El Jardín Secreto may not be the most practical workspace for remote workers, it's an excellent spot for those who need a break from the usual Malasaña hipster nonsense or the tourist traps near Sol. The unique atmosphere, combined with the high-quality coffee and food, make it an ideal spot for a casual meeting or a relaxed work session. If you're willing to work around the limited outlets and busy hours, El Jardín Secreto can be a great addition to your Madrid cafe rotation. Just be sure to arrive early, order a good coffee, and enjoy the charming atmosphere – and don't forget to take a stroll around the beautiful Conde Duque neighborhood, it's de toda la vida Madrid at its best.
