## First Impressions
Cafe Ruiz in Centro is a breath of fresh air, tucked away on a quiet street just a stone's throw from the bustling Puerta del Sol. Unlike the tourist traps near Sol, Ruiz has a de toda la vida feel to it, with a beautiful terraza that's perfect for people-watching on a sunny afternoon. The barrio's eclectic vibe is palpable, with the nearby Mercado de San Miguel and Plaza Mayor adding to the area's charm. As a local, I appreciate how Ruiz avoids the Malasaña hipster nonsense, instead opting for a cozy, no-frills atmosphere that's perfect for a caña or a coffee.

## The Setup
When it comes to getting work done, Ruiz has its pros and cons. The seating area is intimate, with a handful of small tables and a comfortable bench by the window. However, the real challenge is finding a spot with a reliable outlet – I've found that the best bet is to grab a seat at the bar, where there are a few plugs within reach. The wifi is surprisingly fast, making it an excellent spot to catch up on work during the post-siesta rush. Just be sure to avoid la hora del vermut, when the cafe fills up with locals looking to unwind with a drink.

## The Coffee
Ruiz takes its coffee seriously, with a rotating selection of specialty beans from local roasters. The cafe con leche is rich and creamy, and the baristas are always happy to whip up a expertly crafted pour-over. The real standout, however, is the vermouth – Ruiz has an impressive selection, and the staff are more than happy to guide you through the options. If you're looking for a pick-me-up, skip the bland sandwich options and opt for a plate of tortilla or croquetas instead.

## The Verdict
Overall, Cafe Ruiz is a solid choice for remote workers looking for a low-key spot to get some work done. While it may not have the flashy amenities of some of the newer cafes in Malasaña, the atmosphere is warm and inviting, and the staff are always friendly. Just be sure to come prepared – bring your portable charger, and don't expect to find a plethora of outlets. With its excellent coffee, cozy atmosphere, and convenient location, Ruiz is a great spot to add to your rotation, especially if you're looking for a laid-back spot to work during the morning or early afternoon.
