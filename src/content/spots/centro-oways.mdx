## First Impressions
Oways, tucked away in a quiet corner of Centro, is a breath of fresh air compared to the chaotic cafes near Puerta del Sol. As a local, I've grown tired of the overpriced, mediocre coffee that seems to plague the area, but Oways is a pleasant surprise. The exterior is unassuming, but step inside and you'll find a cozy, well-designed space that's perfect for a morning coffee or afternoon pick-me-up. The staff is friendly and attentive, always ready to pour you a caña or serve up a delicious breakfast treat.

## The Setup
For remote workers, Oways has a solid setup. The wifi is fast and reliable, and there are plenty of power outlets scattered throughout the cafe, including a few conveniently located near the large windows that let in plenty of natural light. The seating area is comfortable, with a mix of small tables and larger communal spaces, including a lovely terraza that's perfect for warm days. Unlike some of the trendier cafes in Malasaña, Oways doesn't feel like it's trying too hard to be hip, and the atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming. Just be aware that the 11am café con leche crowd can get a bit lively, and the post-siesta rush can bring in a few more patrons, but it's never too crowded.

## The Coffee
The coffee at Oways is top-notch, with a variety of specialty drinks and expertly pulled shots. I'm a fan of their cortado, which is rich and creamy without being too sweet. They also offer a selection of teas and delicious pastries, including some tasty vegan options. If you're looking for a snack, skip the generic sandwiches and opt for one of their creative tostadas or a plate of crispy patatas bravas. And if you're feeling thirsty, try one of their refreshing glasses of tinto de verano - just be sure to avoid "la hora del vermut" when the cafe can get a bit too lively.

## The Verdict
Overall, Oways is a great spot for remote workers and coffee lovers alike. It's a de toda la vida kind of place, where you can feel comfortable working or simply enjoying a cup of coffee and watching the world go by. The best time to come is probably in the late morning or early afternoon, when the cafe is quiet and you can grab a seat by the window. With its excellent coffee, comfortable seating, and convenient location, Oways is a hidden gem in the heart of Centro - and one that's definitely worth discovering.
