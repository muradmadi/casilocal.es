## First Impressions

Located on Calle del Barco, just steps from Gran Vía, Eatmytrip is a tropical-modernist escape from the city's concrete density. While the review suggests a "de toda la vida" vibe, the operational reality is much more "Global Brunch Hub." It is a woman-owned, vibrant space that prioritizes creative presentation and "Instagrammable" aesthetics. It functions as a refuge not because it is old-school, but because it provides a level of hospitality and "cool" factor that generic Gran Vía chains lack.

## The Setup

Eatmytrip actively courts the digital nomad demographic, yet its physical constraints require a tactical approach. The seating is "tropical cozy"—comfortable, but designed more for brunching than ergonomic eight-hour shifts.

While the staff is notably welcoming to laptop users, power outlets are not ubiquitous; you’ll need to secure a perimeter spot to stay powered up. The Wi-Fi is a major asset, offering the high speeds necessary for remote work that many traditional Madrid cafes lack. However, the "post-siesta rush" here isn't just a few locals—it’s a peak brunch and specialty cake crowd. To maintain a station, you should aim for the early morning window (9:00 AM) or the late afternoon lull before their 5:00 PM close.

## The Coffee

The coffee program is a serious specialty operation, sourcing fair-trade beans from top-tier roasters. The menu is a mix of technical classics (Flat Whites, V60s) and "signature" lattes that lean into the brand’s playful identity.

The advice to skip "touristy" options for a traditional tortilla is actually counter-intuitive here. Eatmytrip’s specialty is **Creative Brunch**. Their Romesco Turkish Eggs and "Barbie" Chai are the technical highlights of the kitchen. If you want a basic tortilla, any corner bar will suffice; come here for the high-concept, globally-inspired dishes that fuel a productive afternoon. The baristas are knowledgeable and contribute to the "tropical vibes" rather than the hushed, clinical atmosphere of a tasting room.

## The Verdict

Eatmytrip Gran Vía is a high-utility hybrid for the remote worker who values high-speed connectivity and a "buzzy" atmosphere over silence. It is not a quiet library; it is a high-energy creative space. It outshines the nearby tourist traps by providing actual technical infrastructure (good coffee + fast internet) within a stylized environment. If you need a power-user setup with guaranteed outlets, keep moving; if you want a vibrant, laptop-friendly brunch spot to hammer out a few hours of work with a high-quality latte, this is a top-tier Centro choice.

**Security Note:** Public WiFi is free and high-speed; utilize a VPN for sensitive data. Given the proximity to Gran Vía and the busy "first come, first served" nature of the seating, keep your devices secured and never leave them unattended.
