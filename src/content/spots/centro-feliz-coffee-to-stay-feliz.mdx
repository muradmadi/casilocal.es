## First Impressions
Feliz Coffee To Stay → Feliz is a hidden gem in the heart of Centro, tucked away on a quiet street just a stone's throw from the bustling Calle de la Princesa. Unlike the tourist traps near Sol, this cafe exudes a genuine, de toda la vida charm that's hard to find in this area. As you step inside, you're greeted by the friendly staff and the inviting aroma of specialty coffee, which immediately sets it apart from the usual cafes that cater to the 11am café con leche crowd.

## The Setup
The workspace at Feliz is cozy, with a few small tables and a comfortable seating area that's perfect for focusing on your work. The outlets are conveniently located near the windows, allowing you to plug in your laptop while still enjoying the natural light. The wifi is fast and reliable, making it an ideal spot for remote workers who need to stay connected. Be sure to arrive before la hora del vermut (around 1 pm) to secure a spot, as the post-siesta rush can get busy. If you're looking for a quiet spot to work, try to avoid the terraza, which can get noisy when the sun comes out.

## The Coffee
The coffee at Feliz is top-notch, with a variety of specialty blends that will satisfy even the most discerning coffee connoisseur. The baristas are knowledgeable and happy to guide you through the menu, which changes seasonally. Be sure to try the cortado, which is expertly crafted and rich in flavor. If you're feeling peckish, the pastries are also delicious, although the selection can be limited at times. Skip the caña (small beer) and opt for a coffee or tea instead, as the focus here is on high-quality beverages rather than beer.

## The Verdict
Overall, Feliz Coffee To Stay → Feliz is a fantastic spot for remote workers who want to experience the authentic charm of Centro. With its fast wifi, convenient outlets, and excellent coffee, it's an ideal spot to get work done. While it may not be the best spot for large groups or those looking for a rowdy atmosphere, it's perfect for individuals who want to focus on their work in a quiet, welcoming environment. Better than the usual Malasaña hipster nonsense, Feliz is a genuine gem that's sure to become a favorite among digital nomads and locals alike.
