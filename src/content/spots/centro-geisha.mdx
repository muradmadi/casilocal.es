## First Impressions
Geisha cafe in Centro is a breath of fresh air amidst the chaos of Calle de la Princesa and the tourist traps near Sol. Tucked away on a quiet street, this quaint cafe is a favorite among locals and remote workers alike. As you step inside, you're greeted by the aroma of specialty coffee and the soothing sounds of jazz, a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of the city. Unlike the hipster cafes in Malasaña, Geisha exudes a warm, de toda la vida charm that makes you feel like you're in a real Madrid cafe, not just some trendy imitation.

## The Setup
The workspace at Geisha is cozy, with a handful of small tables and a bar that's perfect for solo workers or small groups. The seating area is intimate, with comfortable chairs and plenty of natural light pouring in through the large windows. Outlets are plentiful, with several located near the tables and a few more at the bar, so you can keep your devices charged while you work. The best time to come is during the morning, before the 11am café con leche crowd arrives, or in the late afternoon, after the post-siesta rush has died down. Avoid coming during la hora del vermut, when the cafe can get crowded with locals stopping by for a quick caña and some tapas.

## The Coffee
The coffee at Geisha is, without a doubt, some of the best in the city. Their specialty coffee drinks are expertly crafted, with a focus on quality and presentation. The flat white is a standout, with a rich, velvety texture and a perfect balance of flavors. The cappuccinos, on the other hand, are a bit more hit-or-miss, with some days being better than others. If you're looking for a strong coffee, skip the cappuccino and opt for a café solo or a cortado instead. And don't even get me started on the pastries - the croissants are flaky and buttery, and the torta de aceite is a must-try.

## The Verdict
Geisha cafe is a hidden gem in the heart of Centro, a neighborhood that's equal parts charming and chaotic. While it may not be the most ideal spot for focused work, due to the lack of air conditioning and potential crowds, it's a great place to relax and enjoy a coffee or snack. The terraza is a lovely spot to people-watch, and the staff is friendly and attentive. If you're looking for a real Madrid experience, skip the tourist traps and head to Geisha instead. Just be sure to arrive early, and don't forget to order a caña to go with your coffee - it's the perfect way to experience la vida madrileña.
