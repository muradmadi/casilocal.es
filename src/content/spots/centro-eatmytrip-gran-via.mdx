## First Impressions
Tucked away on Gran Vía, Eatmytrip Gran Vía is a breath of fresh air in the bustling Centro neighborhood. Unlike the tourist traps near Sol, this cafe has a genuine, de toda la vida vibe that's hard to find in the area. As a local, I've watched this spot become a staple for the 11am café con leche crowd and a haven for those seeking refuge from the chaos of Gran Vía. The terraza outside is a bonus, perfect for people-watching and soaking up the sun on a warm Madrid morning.

## The Setup
When it comes to getting work done, Eatmytrip Gran Vía has its pros and cons. The seating area is cozy, with comfortable chairs and ample table space, but it's not exactly designed with remote workers in mind. You won't find any fancy co-working amenities here, but the staff is happy to let you plug in your laptop - just ask, and they'll point you to one of the few outlets scattered around the room. Be warned: the cafe can get busy during peak hours, especially during the post-siesta rush, so it's best to come early or later in the evening to avoid the chaos.

## The Coffee
The coffee at Eatmytrip Gran Vía is top-notch, with a rotating selection of specialty beans and expertly crafted pour-overs. Unlike some of the hipster cafes in Malasaña, this place doesn't take itself too seriously, and the baristas are always happy to chat about the latest football match or recommend a good spot for a caña. The menu is concise but well-curated, with a focus on simple, well-made dishes that won't break the bank. Skip the touristy breakfast options and opt for a traditional Spanish breakfast instead - the tortilla de patatas is a highlight.

## The Verdict
In conclusion, Eatmytrip Gran Vía is a solid choice for remote workers who don't need all the frills. It's not the most productive spot, perhaps, but the atmosphere is warm and inviting, and the coffee is always on point. Just be sure to avoid la hora del vermut, when the cafe can get crowded with locals enjoying a pre-lunch drink, and you'll be golden. With its unique blend of old-school Madrid charm and modern amenities, Eatmytrip Gran Vía is a hidden gem in the heart of the city - and one that's definitely worth a visit, even if you're not a digital nomad.
