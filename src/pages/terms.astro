            <h2>1. The Agreement</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to <strong>CasiLocal</strong>. By accessing this website, you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, do not use the directory.
            </p>
            <p>
                We operate from Madrid, Spain. These terms are governed by Spanish law.
            </p>

            <h2>2. The Nature of the Data (Disclaimer)</h2>
            <p>
                CasiLocal is a directory of subjective audits and snapshot data.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>No Guarantee of Persistence:</strong> A cafe listed as "Quiet" today may be a construction site tomorrow. A spot with "Flynet" WiFi may experience an ISP outage. We provide data based on a specific point in time (the "Audit Date"). We do not guarantee real-time accuracy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Use at Your Own Risk:</strong> We are not responsible if a location is closed, full, or unsuitable upon your arrival. Always check Google Maps for real-time operating hours before traveling.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. User Contributions</h2>

                When you submit a spot, review, or photo ("Intel") to CasiLocal, you agree to the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>License to Use:</strong> You retain ownership of your content, but you grant CasiLocal a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to display, reproduce, and modify that content for the purpose of operating the directory.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Accuracy:</strong> You promise that your submission is based on actual, first-hand experience. You will not submit false reviews to boost or harm a business.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Copyright:</strong> You promise that any photo you upload was taken by you. Do not upload images from Google Images, Instagram, or third parties.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>
                The design, code, "Casi Score" algorithm, and specific curation of the CasiLocal directory are the intellectual property of CasiLocal.
            </p>
            <p>
                 You may not copy our schema or design for your own commercial project without permission.
            </p>
            <p>
                The raw facts (e.g., "HanSo Cafe is at Calle del Pez") are not copyrighted, but our description and rating of them are.

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lost Work:</strong> Any loss of productivity, data, or revenue resulting from reliance on our recommendations (e.g., if you miss a deadline because a "Reliable" spot lost internet).</li>

            <h2>7. Third-Party Links</h2>
            <p>
                We link to Google Maps and individual venue websites. We do not control these external sites and are not responsible for their content or privacy practices.

            <h2>8. Modifications</h2>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Continued use of CasiLocal after a change constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
