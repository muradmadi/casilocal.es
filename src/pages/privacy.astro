            <h2>1. The Controller</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>CasiLocal</strong> ("we," "us," or "our") operates this website. We are based in Madrid, Spain. 
                We are the Data Controller responsible for your personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
            </p>

            <h2>2. What We Collect & Why</h2>
            <p>
                We practice <strong>Data Minimization</strong>. We do not want your data unless it is strictly necessary to operate the directory.
            </p>
            
            <h3>A. Information You Provide Voluntarily</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>"Submit Intel" Form:</strong> If you submit a new spot or a correction, we may collect your email address (optional) to verify the submission or notify you of publication.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Content & Media:</strong> Any text reviews or photos you upload are processed to be displayed publicly on the CasiLocal directory. By uploading, you grant us a non-exclusive license to display this content.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>B. Technical Data (The Infrastructure)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Local Storage:</strong> We use your browser’s Local Storage to save your interface preferences (e.g., if you toggled "Dark Mode" or filtered by "Silence"). This data stays on your device and is never sent to our servers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Server Logs:</strong> Our hosting provider automatically logs IP addresses and request timestamps for security purposes (DDoS protection, error debugging). These logs are retained for a limited period and then purged.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Third-Party Processors</h2>
            <p>
                We rely on specific external services to power the infrastructure. We have ensured these partners are compliant with EU data standards.
            </p>
